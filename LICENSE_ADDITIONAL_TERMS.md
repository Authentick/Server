# Additional License Terms

The Authentick project is distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License ("AGPL") version 3. The AGPL license allows supplementing the license for some specific reasons, as described in section 7.

In addition to the general license terms, the following requirements also apply to users of Authentick.

In case of any questions, please contact us as described on [our website](https://www.authentick.net/legal/imprint).

## Preservation of attributions
We are requesting that you do not remove any author or project attribution from the application. In addition to AGPL requirements, we also ask that you do not remove end-user-facing terms such as “Powered by Authentick” or similar.

However, we consider it fair use to remove any attribution using any built-in theming functionalities in the original Authentick software.

## Marking of modified versions
We request that you not publish any modified version of Authentick under the same or related names.

In practice, this means that if you have a custom build of Authentick, you should not call it Authentick, or similar names such as “Authentick+” or “Authentick Gold”. But you would be able to publish it under an entirely different product name.

## Limit for publicity purposes
We do not grant any publicity rights.

In practice, this means that if you want to advertise Authentick on your website, for example, due to offering hosting services for Authentick, we do ask that you get prior permission from us.

## Grant of trademarks
We do not grant any trademark rights.

In practice, this means that Authentick may include registered and unregistered trademarks. We request that you either obtain permission to use these terms or change them before publishing any custom build or using them in another form.
