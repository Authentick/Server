## What is Gatekeeper?

Gatekeeper is an upcoming open-source identity management solution. The aim of the project is to provide an identity management solution that is:

- Easy to install
- Easy to configure
- Secure by default
- Self-hosted and under your control

Gatekeeper allows you to create users, grant them access to other services, and enforce strong security controls.

## Get your Gatekeeper

Gatekeeper is currently under development and we advise against any production usage. Gatekeeper can currently only be installed from source.
